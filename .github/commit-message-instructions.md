## Git Commit Message Guidelines

When creating Git commit messages, please adhere to the following guidelines:

* **Subject-Body Separation:** Separate the subject line from the body with a blank line.

* **Subject Line Punctuation:** Do not end the subject line with a period.

* **Capitalization:** Capitalize the subject line and the first word of each paragraph in the body.

* **Imperative Mood:** Use the imperative mood in the subject line (e.g., "Fix bug," not "Fixed bug").

* **Line Wrapping:** Wrap lines in the body at 72 characters.

* **Body Content:**

    * Explain *what* and *why* changes were made.

    * Avoid detailing *how* changes were implemented (focus on the outcome).

    * Describe why a change is being made.

    * Explain how it addresses the issue.

    * Detail the effects of the patch.

    * Do not assume the reviewer understands what the original problem was.

    * Do not assume the code is self-evident/self-documenting.

    * Read the commit message to see if it hints at improved code structure.

    * The first commit line is the most important.

    * Describe any limitations of the current code.

    * Do not include patch set-specific comments.
